# To-Do

* Enable selection of interfaces to bridge
* Automatically set XZone service as IS default
* Allow bridging from iPhone on Yosemite
* Streamline code
* Make sure we can't parallel run!
* Allow safe exit from traffic light close
* Allow multiple launch options
* Active Playtime setting
* Improve disabled cycling
* Create a GUI or AppleScript launcher (v1.0 milestone!)
* Notification Centre integration (probably with GUI)
* Comment code more clearly
* Run as a daemon instead of via Terminal
* Clean up SSIDs and their respective indices
* Timestamp MAC usage to prevent abuse
* Allow adding of own MACs to plist (and upload?!)
* Check for changes to IS config outside of XZone runtime
